# 2D Platformer - High School Programming Assignment

This is a 2D platformer game developed as a high school programming assignment. It's written in JavaScript and utilizes [simple.js from spelprogrammering.nu](https://spelprogrammering.nu/simple.js) as a canvas script.

## Overview

The game is visually minimalistic and doesnt really have many features or much to do in it as I am not very good at game and level design.

Features:
- **Checkpoints:** Save your progress at checkpoints throughout the game.
- **Enemies:** Encounter a purple enemy to avoid or overcome.
- **Collectibles:** Gather green objects to score points.
- **Lava Hazard:** Beware of lava, it's deadly!

## Usage

### Installation
There is no specific installation process. You can run the game by copying the files to your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and running it there using a local server setup. I used Visual Studio Code with the Web Preview extension for development.

### Running the Game
1. Copy the project files to your IDE.
2. Run the game on a local server using your IDE's setup.
3. Open the game in a web browser to play.

## Notes
- The game was developed as part of a high school programming assignment, hence its minimalist visual design.
- Feel free to experiment, modify, or enhance the game as needed!
